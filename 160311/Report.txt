I finished creating the add entry dialog and put in the MySQL command so that
all entries can be added properly. To get the entry dialog working properly,
I had to learn how to use a JComboBox and devise a way to store the categories
inside of the database.

You can now register a new user and be able to log in. There should no longer 
be any issues with authenticating a user after they register. Currently working
on a way for the program to display all entries in the database. After that, I 
will need to sort the entries based on category, date purchased, date submitted,
and price.
