I completed the timelogging program. It now keeps track of when an employee logs in and logs out and inputs that data
into a MySQL database. There is a second program that will take these times and calculate how many hours a person
has worked rounding to the nearest half hour. It also multiplies hours worked by hourly wage. Next week, I will try
to make the estimated monthly earning more accurate by accounting for taxes and other factors. The second program also
needs to be improved to allow the user to input a range of days that they want for hours so that they can set it to only
count hours between set days. 

A third program was created for ease of set up that will clear out the MySQL DB and recreate all of the base tables with
data. It could have a practical use if we would need to reset the DB for any reason. A fourth program needs to be created 
so that someone without knowledge of MySQL commands can add or remove employees or modify their wages and any other info.

A side project has grown to where I want the tracking to work through Hangouts (Google's IM service). Employees already
send messages into there saying "(ID): [In/Out]" indicating when they arrive at work and when they leave. Hopefully, I 
can use a FOSS Javascript program to log messages into that group chat and use the message contents/timestamp/sender to 
keep track of employees' hours so that they don't have to remember to start and stop my program. This will be challenging
though, and I don't anticipate that this will be completed until summer time.
