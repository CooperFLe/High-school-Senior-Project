This week, I continued working on the time log program for my dad. I started by removing the always on top function because father didn't want that. Then I added a JFrame to use as the parent of the JDialog so that it would appear in the taskbar. Next, I had to add a Window Listener in order to close the program when the JDialog was closed. Before I did, the program continued running even after the JDialog was closed. After I did this, I had to make sure that an employee didn't "accidently" close the program while the timer was still running. In order to do this, I used the Window Listener and added an if statement. If the timer was stopped, close the program as expected. If the timer was still going, I used a JOptionPane message to tell the user that the timer was still going and set the default close operation to do nothing in order to prevent the dialog from closing. This work almost exactly as expected. There was an issue where the Window Listener was ran twice, so the JOptionPane appeared twice. In order to prevent this behavior, I added an int value to the program. Everytime the Window Listener was activated, I increased the int by one. The I put an if statement before the JOptionPane message so it would only appear if that int value was possitive. This worked, much to my surprise, and the JOptionPane was only shown once. I still haven't been able to get to my dad's office in order to set up the server there, but I placed framework code that is currently commented out that will hopefully verify the email entered and return the name of the table for that particular employee. I also played around with Eclipse export and found it was really easy to export a .jar file, so I also did that.
