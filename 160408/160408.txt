My dad asked me to create a program for his employees to use to clock into work and clock out.
His requirements were that it was stupid simple for the employees to use and to make sure that
they couldn't "accidently" clock in for someone else instead of themselves. In order to achive this,
I opted for a simple GUI consisting of a single button to clock in and clock out. I hope to add a 
timer to the GUI that shows them how long they have been working, but I am not sure if that would
be okay with my dad as this program will actually be in use. I currently have it so that the window
is always on top of the screen, but I may have to add an option to hide it for a set amount of time
as clients often look off of the employee's computer in order to see specific information about thier
policies. In order to achive this and implement the timer, I am going to need to find a way for the
program to wait for a set amount of time without having to use a for loop or anything else of that 
nature that could lead to poor performance or issues like not being able to interact with the program
while it is trying to keep track of time.

This should be a very simple program that I finish by next week and can return to trying to get my
finance tracker to import data from the order history from Amazon.
