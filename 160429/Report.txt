I made decent progress in my program. After talking to the office manager, I finally
got a list of employees and their email address. Then I set up the database for testing
purposes on my laptop. The timer is now working. The program will record the time they
started and write to the database when they clock out with the clock in time and the 
clock out time. MySQL then will automatically generate a timestamp for the entry so that
I can get the date. 

My next step will be to get the pay rates for the employees and add that to the database.
Then I will have to create a separate program for the office manager to get hours, pay rate,
and base pay of the employees. If I complete that before the end of the week, I will then 
make a way for the office manager to edit hourly rates and possible add calculations to 
account for bonuses and tax.
