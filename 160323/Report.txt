I finally uploaded my code to Github on Monday and chose an open source license. https://github.com/ThyKoopa/FinanceSQL
Tuesday and Wednesday, I worked on implementing a way for users to upload a .csv file of their Amazon purchase history.
I had to write my own algorithem to pharse incoming data because of the way the data is stored in the .csv. Sometimes
there will be double quotes around items, and sometimes there wouldn't be. The double quotes would be around a single
value that contains a comma that is part of that value. This prevents me from effectively splitting the data using commas
or double quotes, so I had to figure out a way to do it myself. I am nearly done with that, but I still need to work out a
few logical errors. For most cases, my current method works.
