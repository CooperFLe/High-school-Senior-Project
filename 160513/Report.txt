I spent all week looking through different ways to get Google Hangouts chat logs.
Unfortunately, there is no API to access the messages. What I have to do is either
figure out one of the Google Takeout parser that will take the json file that Google
gives you with all of the Google Hangouts messages and convert it to stuff that I can
actually use. Or I can figure out the Hangouts boot that is written in JavaScript and
try to implement that. I am not having a lot of luck with figuring out what everything
does though. I might just give up on that a work on math calculations.
